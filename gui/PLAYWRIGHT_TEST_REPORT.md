# Playwright GUI Testing Report

## Summary

The comprehensive Playwright test revealed significant issues with the GUI application:

### Key Findings

1. **All tested pages show 404 errors** - Most navigation routes are not implemented
2. **No actual forms found** - The GUI appears to be a single-page application with forms rendered conditionally
3. **High volume of network errors** - 60 network failures due to missing routes
4. **Console errors** - 60 console errors related to failed resource loading
5. **Accessibility issues** - 7 form inputs without proper labels on the home page

### Test Results

#### Navigation Test Results
- ✅ **Home (/)**: Successfully loaded
- ❌ **Business Calendars (/business-calendars)**: 404 Not Found
- ❌ **Departments (/departments)**: 404 Not Found
- ❌ **All other routes**: Test timed out or returned 404 errors

#### Form Submission Test Results
- **No forms found**: 0 forms detected on all tested pages
- **Root cause**: Forms are embedded within the single-page application and not accessible via individual routes

#### Accessibility Test Results
- **Home page**: 7 form inputs without proper labels
- **Other pages**: Most accessibility checks couldn't complete due to 404 errors

### Architecture Analysis

Based on the `page.tsx` analysis, the application is structured as:

1. **Single Page Application**: All forms are rendered conditionally on the home page (`/`)
2. **Client-side navigation**: Uses React state (`activeSection`) to switch between forms
3. **No routing**: Individual form URLs like `/departments`, `/machines` don't exist

### Forms Actually Available
The following forms are implemented and should be accessible via the sidebar navigation:

- DepartmentForm
- JobTemplateForm  
- MachineForm
- SetupTimeForm
- TemplateTaskForm
- WorkCellForm
- BusinessCalendarForm
- OperatorForm
- SkillForm
- SequenceResourceForm
- MaintenanceTypeForm
- JobInstanceForm

### Recommendations

1. **Fix Testing Approach**: Test forms by navigating within the SPA rather than using direct URLs
2. **Implement Routing**: Consider adding proper Next.js routing for individual form pages
3. **Fix Accessibility**: Add proper labels to form inputs
4. **Add Form Validation**: Implement proper form submission handling

### Next Steps for Proper Testing

To properly test this application, we need to:

1. Navigate to the home page (`/`)
2. Use the sidebar navigation to switch between forms
3. Test form submissions within the SPA context
4. Focus on component-level testing rather than route-based testing

The current test approach was designed for a multi-page application, but this is actually a single-page application with client-side navigation.
