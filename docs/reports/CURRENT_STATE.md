# Fresh Solver - Current State Summary

## Overview
The Fresh Solver is an OR-Tools based production scheduling system that optimizes job scheduling across machines while respecting various constraints.

## Sprint Progress

### Sprint 1 (Phase 0: Cleanup and Stabilization) - PARTIALLY COMPLETE
✅ **Completed**:
- All constraint functions have unit tests
- Architecture documentation (CLAUDE.md system)
- Constraint pattern library (CONSTRAINT_PATTERNS.md)
- Code follows 30-line rule and has type hints
- Extensive Claude documentation system

❌ **Pending**:
- 90%+ test coverage measurement
- Performance baseline benchmarks
- API documentation (no API yet)

### Sprint 2-3 (Phase 1: Enhanced Machine Constraints) - IN PROGRESS
✅ **Completed**:
- Setup time constraints (Phase 1.2)

❌ **Pending**:
- Machine capacity constraints (Phase 1.1)
- Machine availability windows (Phase 1.3)

## Completed Features

### Core Infrastructure ✅
- **OR-Tools CP-SAT Integration**: Full solver implementation with decision variables
- **Data Models**: Complete problem representation (Jobs, Tasks, Machines, etc.)
- **Database Integration**: Supabase connection with test/production switching
- **Time Handling**: 15-minute interval system throughout

### Implemented Constraints ✅

#### Phase 1 Basic Constraints
1. **Task Duration Constraints**
   - Links start, duration, and end variables
   - Supports variable durations based on machine mode

2. **Precedence Constraints**
   - Ensures task dependencies are respected
   - Includes redundant constraints for performance

3. **Machine Assignment Constraints**
   - Exactly one machine mode per task
   - Duration depends on selected mode

4. **No-Overlap Constraints**
   - Prevents task conflicts on same machine
   - Uses interval variables for efficiency

5. **Setup Time Constraints** (NEW - Phase 1.2) ✅
   - Sequence-dependent setup times between tasks
   - Conditional enforcement based on machine assignment
   - Configurable per task pair and machine
   - Full unit test coverage

### Solver Features ✅
- **Objective**: Makespan minimization
- **Search Strategy**: CHOOSE_FIRST with SELECT_MIN_VALUE
- **Parallel Search**: 8 workers for faster solving
- **Time Limits**: Configurable solving time

## Next Steps (Phase 1 Continuation)

### 1.1 Machine Capacity Constraints (Next)
- Support machines that can handle multiple tasks simultaneously
- Implement cumulative constraints for resource usage

### 1.3 Machine Availability Windows
- Define maintenance windows and shifts
- Prevent scheduling during unavailable periods

## Usage Example

```python
from src.solver.core.solver import FreshSolver
from src.data.loaders.database import load_test_problem

# Load problem from database
problem = load_test_problem()

# Define setup times (optional)
setup_times = {
    ("task_1", "task_2", "machine_1"): 2,  # 30 minutes setup
    ("task_2", "task_3", "machine_1"): 1,  # 15 minutes setup
}

# Create and solve
solver = FreshSolver(problem, setup_times=setup_times)
solution = solver.solve(time_limit=60)

# Results include task schedules respecting all constraints
```

## Performance Targets
- **Small** (50 tasks): < 10 seconds ✓
- **Medium** (500 tasks): < 60 seconds (pending verification)
- **Large** (5000 tasks): < 30 minutes (future target)
